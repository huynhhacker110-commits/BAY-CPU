# 💀 Mini WAF API
> A lightweight Web Application Firewall built to detect and block real-world attacks.

---

## 🛡️ Overview

This project is a self-built Web Application Firewall designed to simulate real-world defense mechanisms against common web attacks.

Instead of only learning theory, this project focuses on **practical implementation of attack detection and mitigation**.

---

## 🔥 Features

- 🚫 **DDoS Protection**
  - Rate limiting per IP
  - Temporary IP blocking

- 💀 **XSS Detection**
  - Pattern-based detection
  - Input normalization to prevent bypass

- 🧠 **SQL Injection Detection**
  - Detects common injection patterns
  - Filters malicious payloads

- 📊 **Logging System**
  - Tracks suspicious activity
  - Helps analyze attack behavior

---

## ⚔️  Simulation

### XSS Attack
```json
{"data": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}

# 🔥 Mini WAF API

A lightweight Web Application Firewall built with FastAPI.

## 🛡️ Features
- Anti DDoS (Rate Limiting)
- XSS Detection
- SQL Injection Detection
- IP Blacklisting
- Logging System

## 💀 Demo

Example attack:
```json
{"data":"<script>alert(1)</script>"}

@app.post("/check")
async def check(data: dict):
    return {"result": detect_xss(data["input"])}

@app.post("/check")
async def check(data: dict):
    return {"result": detect_xss(data["input"])}

timestamp + IP + reason

## 🎯 Use Case
- Protect small web apps from common attacks
- Educational security testing
